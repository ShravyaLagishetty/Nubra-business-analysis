Nubra Market Sizing & GTM Strategy

This project outlines a Go-to-Market (GTM) plan and market sizing model for Nubra, with a focus on introducing engineers in India to the trading ecosystem.

The work combines business strategy (TAM–SAM–SOM analysis, phased GTM roadmap, performance metrics) with a Streamlit-powered interactive tool that allows scenario-based testing.

Project Overview
Objective: Enable engineers in India—students, working professionals, and freelancers—to adopt trading through Nubra.
Methodology: Estimate market potential using TAM, SAM, and SOM; design a phased GTM rollout covering the first year.
Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib.
Market Sizing Framework

Total Addressable Market (TAM)

Definition: All engineers in India.
Formula: TAM = Students + Professionals
Estimate: Approximately 15–16 million engineers.

Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

Definition: Engineers with smartphone access, internet connectivity, and disposable income.
Formula: SAM = TAM × Smartphone Penetration Rate
Estimate: Roughly 9–10 million engineers.

Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

Definition: Engineers that Nubra can realistically onboard in the first year.
Formula: SOM = SAM × Adoption Rate
Estimate: Around 300,000–500,000 engineers.
Revenue Projection
Formula: Revenue = SOM × Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
Streamlit App Features
Interactive TAM–SAM–SOM calculator with dynamic inputs.
Sliders for smartphone penetration, adoption percentage, and ARPU.
Visualization tools:
TAM vs. SAM vs. SOM (bar chart).
State-wise SOM and revenue comparisons.
Adoption sensitivity analysis (1–10% scenarios).
Filters: State-level breakdowns with penetration adjustments.
Export option: Downloadable CSV reports.
1-Year GTM Roadmap

Phase 1: Awareness (Months 1–3)

Campus events, influencer-led promotions, and awareness campaigns.

Phase 2: Acquisition (Months 4–6)

Referral-based growth, gamified trading contests, and corporate pilots.

Phase 3: Engagement & Monetization (Months 7–12)

Certification programs, engineer-driven communities, and premium feature rollouts.
Success Metrics
Adoption: New user signups, CAC, percentage of referrals.
Engagement: DAU/MAU, trades per user, participation in contests and learning activities.
Retention: 30/60/90-day benchmarks, churn levels, repeat usage.
Business Outcomes: ARPU, LTV, and total revenue from certifications, premium tools, and trading activity.
